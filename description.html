            In Greek mythology, the Titanomachy (/ˌtaɪtəˈnɒməki/; Ancient Greek:
            Τιτανομαχία, romanized: Titanomakhía, lit. 'Titan-battle', Latin:
            Titanomachia) was a ten-year[1] series of battles fought in Ancient
            Thessaly, consisting of most of the Titans (the older generation of
            gods, based on Mount Othrys) fighting against the Olympians (the
            younger generations, who would come to reign on Mount Olympus) and
            their allies. This event is also known as the War of the Titans,
            Battle of the Titans, Battle of the Gods, or just the Titan War. The
            war was fought to decide which generation of gods would have
            dominion over the universe; it ended in victory for the Olympian
            gods. Greeks of the Classical Age knew of several poems about the
            war between the gods and many of the Titans. The dominant one, and
            the only one that has survived, is the Theogony attributed to
            Hesiod. The Titans also played a prominent role in the poems
            attributed to Orpheus. Although only scraps of the Orphic narratives
            survive, they show differences from the Hesiodic tradition.
